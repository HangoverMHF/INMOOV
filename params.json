She had her arm amputated when newborn from complications arising from errors of a medical procedure.\r\n\r\nSeeing the restrictions it faces on a day-to-day, I thought about how to help. Of course we are not specialized in biotechnology, but we know well technology, and a little robotic. We have a garage, which already has a robotic arm with the leap motion interface ... I researched a bit and soon found the http://inmoov.fr/. What exactly is the project that we use in the garage for our robotic arm.\r\n\r\nRecently talking to Bianca, I suggested that we try to do something to alleviate this limitation it has, I expected it to be a difficult conversation, but she was extremely receptive and was very happy about the idea. The first barrier was over.\r\n\r\nDo not stop there, we took the idea for The Garage, a colleague(Junqueira) made the contacts, and managed the HR staff in yield to 3D printer for printing of the parties, and more than that, got sponsorship for materials necessary. Ie, CI&T will pay everything from filament, servo motors, Arduino, everything ... We just need to spend our free time in it.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, while sharing the idea with Marcos, he had the idea and the initiative of an interesting arm control interface via smartphone gestures and accelerometer, and he has codified a PoC showing this idea. In other words, we already have the software direction as well.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we have a ready and functional design robotic arm. We just need to print and assemble. We have sponsorship for the costs, we have knowledge and will, but we need to devote our time, and we need volunteers to make it happen.\r\n\r\nI know we can, but without utopias, will not be easy. I know a lot can go wrong, especially if we are just few involved. But one way or another we will give our 2 cents to change the world.\r\n\r\nWho is willing to help us in this project?\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be inspired, follows some links:\r\n\r\n### Base project:\r\n(http://inmoov.fr/)\r\nVoice Controlled:\r\n(http://www.instructables.com/id/Voice-Controlled-Prosthetic-Hand-Forearm/?ALLSTEPS)\r\nSkin:\r\n(http://www.instructables.com/id/Using-gelatin-for-moulds-and-prosthetics/)\r\n\r\n### github project\r\n(https://github.com/glaudiston/project-bianca)\r\n(http://glaudiston.github.io/project-bianca/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
